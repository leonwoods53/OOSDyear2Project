# OOSDyear2Project
This is my Year 2 object-oriented software development project. System is designed to manage customer purchases for a sports equipment store, using a Java GUI as the front-end, and MySQL to create the back-end database, as well as implementing a JDBC to connect both aspects of the system. System will be used by staff of the store to manage customer details, invoices and stock.
